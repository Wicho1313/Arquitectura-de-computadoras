@W: MT529 :"c:\users\alejandro\desktop\5to semestre\arquitectura de computadoras\practicas de entrenamiento\barrelrotate00\barrelrotate00\source\div00.vhdl":22:1:22:2|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including SR00.D01.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
