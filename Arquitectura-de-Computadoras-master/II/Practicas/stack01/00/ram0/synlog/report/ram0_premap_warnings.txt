@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\yair\desktop\arquitectura\practicas\ram00\dynamic\stack\ramvf\02\00\div00.vhdl":20:2:20:3|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 22 sequential elements including RA00.DI01.sdiv[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
