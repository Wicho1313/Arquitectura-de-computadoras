To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\ameri\documentos\escom\arquitectura\arquitectura-de-computadoras-master\ii\practicas\lcd01\div00.vhd":21:2:21:3|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 22 sequential elements including L00.OS01.sdiv[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
