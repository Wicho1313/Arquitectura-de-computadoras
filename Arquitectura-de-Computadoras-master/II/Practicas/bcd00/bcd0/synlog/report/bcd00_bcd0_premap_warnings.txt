@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\farol\documents\arquitecturadecomputadoras3cm1\div00vhdl\div00.vhdl":20:3:20:4|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 46 sequential elements including BCD00.D01.sdiv[22:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
