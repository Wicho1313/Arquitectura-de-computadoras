@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\elite\onedrive\escritorio\key02\div00.vhd":20:2:20:3|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 22 sequential elements including Div.D01.sdiv[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
