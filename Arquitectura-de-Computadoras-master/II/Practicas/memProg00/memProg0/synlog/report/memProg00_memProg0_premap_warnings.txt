@W: MT529 :"c:\users\ameri\documentos\escom\arquitectura\arquitectura-de-computadoras-master\ii\practicas\memprog00\div00.vhd":20:2:20:3|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 22 sequential elements including RO00.DI01.sdiv[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
